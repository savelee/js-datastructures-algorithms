# What do we know about Sets?

Set objects are collections of values.
You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.

A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

Because each value in the Set has to be unique, the value equality will be checked.

Since Set only contains distinct elements, it makes life much easier if we know in advance we want to avoid saving duplicate data to our structure.

In Mathematics, it has concepts such as union, difference and intersection.
