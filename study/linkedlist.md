# What do we know about LinkedLists?
 
It's a sequential data structure and has similarities with an Array (also called a List).

In other languages, an Array has a predefined size. Inserting and Removing items can be expensive. Because elements needs to be shifted
over. A LinkedList is a dynamic data structure. We can add and remove items from it and it will grow
when required. Elements are not placed
contiguously in memory. Each node stores the element itself and also a reference (pointer link). Think about this as christmas lights. In order to find a broken light, you have to visit
each light from beginning (head) to end (tail).

## Real world examples in Software Engineering?

History and Subversioning? A trial of revisions and you can add branches?
